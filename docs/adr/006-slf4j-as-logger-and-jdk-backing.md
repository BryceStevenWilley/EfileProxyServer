# Logger Library Choice

Status: Partially chosen, partially in progress


TODO(brycew): document this as it was chosen.

SLF4j is a good idea anyway. I have no idea the best way to run
production logs, so being able to swap is nice. JDK is the simplest
backing logger, so let's use it.

Still haven't been able to get a config file working yet though. :/
